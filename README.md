# Autonomous RC Plane Stabilizer
This system is designed to control UAV's movement due to external forces. This system measures the deviation in planes motion with reference to pilots input and provides accurate compensation to bring back the UAV into the path which the pilot intends it to drive. This system also can be used for locking UAV onto a certain path.
